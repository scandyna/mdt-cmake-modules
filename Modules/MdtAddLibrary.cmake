# MdtAddLibrary
# ---------------------
#
# TODO should create a page that explains the various target properties used in Mdt modules.
#
# Target various names
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# Add a library:
#
# .. code-block:: cmake
#
#   add_library(Led led.cpp)
#
# Here the name of the target is ``Led``.
# Such name is too generic, and it can clash with names from other project.
#
# It is better to prefix the project name to the library target name,
# for example: Qt_Led or Kf_Led or Mdt_Led:
#
# .. code-block:: cmake
#
#   add_library(Mdt_Led led.cpp)
#
# It is also good practice to add a alias target:
#
# .. code-block:: cmake
#
#   add_library(Mdt::Led ALIAS Mdt_Led)
#
# Here, ``Mdt::Led`` is a read only alias target to ``Mdt_Led``.
#
# In a other part of the same project, this alias should be used,
# enforcing that we not modify its properties:
#
# .. code-block:: cmake
#
#   add_executable(Mdt_Led_Test test.cpp)
#   target_link_libraries(Mdt_Led_Test Mdt::Led)
#
# Note: it is attempting to directly create Mdt::Led:
#
# .. code-block:: cmake
#
#   add_library(Mdt::Led led.cpp)
#
# CMake will not allow above add_library() statement.
#
# At some point, the project (composed of several targets) should be installed.
# It shouls also be taken ito account that the project can be installed in directories shared with other projects.
# This is typically the case for a system wide installation on Linux.
# In such case, the library so name should be unique::
#
#   libQtLed.so
#   libKfLed.so
#   libMdtLed.so
#
# The headers should also be installed into a project specific directory::
#
# /usr/include/Qt
# /usr/include/KF
# /usr/include/Mdt
#
# A other good practice is also to be able to install
# incompatible versions of the project on the same system without clashes::
#
# /usr/include/Qt4
# /usr/include/Qt5
# /usr/include/KF5
# /usr/include/Mdt0
# /usr/include/Mdt1
#
# For this purpose, the concept of ``INSTALL_NAMESPACE`` will be used:
#
# .. code-block:: cmake
#
#   install(TARGETS Mdt_Led EXPORT MdtLedTargets)
#   install(EXPORT MdtLedTargets NAMESPACE Mdt0:: FILE Mdt0LedTargets.cmake)
#
# Above code will generate and install the ``Mdt0LedTargets.cmake`` file.
# This file is ment to be used by the consumer of the project,
# and it will define a Imported Target:
#
# .. code-block:: cmake
#
#   # Content of Mdt0LedTargets.cmake
#   add_library(Mdt0::Mdt_Led SHARED IMPORTED)
#
# Notice the name of the imported target: ``Mdt0::Mdt_Led``.
# To avoid this, CMake provides a way to define a EXPORT_NAME property:
#
# .. code-block:: cmake
#
#   set_target_properties(Mdt_Led PROPERTIES EXPORT_NAME Led)
#
# The install/export becomes:
#
# .. code-block:: cmake
#
#   set_target_properties(Mdt_Led PROPERTIES EXPORT_NAME Led)
#   install(TARGETS Mdt_Led EXPORT MdtLedTargets)
#   install(EXPORT MdtLedTargets NAMESPACE Mdt0:: FILE Mdt0LedTargets.cmake)
#
# And the generated ``Mdt0LedTargets.cmake`` file will create the expected target:
#
# .. code-block:: cmake
#
#   # Content of Mdt0LedTargets.cmake
#   add_library(Mdt0::Led SHARED IMPORTED)
#
#
# Add a library
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# Add a library::
#
#   mdt_add_library(
#     NAMESPACE NameSpace
#     LIBRARY_NAME LibraryName
#     [PUBLIC_DEPENDENCIES <dependencies>]
#     [PRIVATE_DEPENDENCIES <dependencies>]
#     SOURCE_FILES
#       file1.cpp
#       file2.cpp
#   )
#
# This will create a target ``NameSpace_LibraryName`` and also a ALIAS target ``NameSpace::LibraryName`` .
# To define other properties to the target, use ``NameSpace_LibraryName``
# (CMake will trow errors if ``NameSpace::LibraryName`` is used).
#
# Note: each dependency passed to PUBLIC_DEPENDENCIES and PRIVATE_DEPENDENCIES must be a target.
#
# Example::
#
#   mdt_add_library(
#     NAMESPACE Mdt
#     LIBRARY_NAME Led
#     PUBLIC_DEPENDENCIES Mdt::Core Qt5::Widgets
#     SOURCE_FILES
#       Mdt/Led.cpp
#   )
#
# This will create a target ``Mdt_Led`` and a alias target ``Mdt::Led`` .
#
# Add a "Multi-Dev-Tools" library::
#
#   mdt_add_mdt_library(
#     LIBRARY_NAME LibraryName
#     SOURCE_FILES
#       file1.cpp
#       file2.cpp
#   )
#
# This will create a target ``Mdt_LibraryName`` and a alias target ``Mdt::LibraryName`` .
#
# Install a library
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# TODO for install, do not include GNUInstallDirs and MdtInstallDirs, but document that they are required
#      this allows the user to do some setup before..
#
# TODO Public and Private dependencies
#
# Install a library::
#
#   mdt_install_library(
#     TARGET <target>
#     RUNTIME_DESTINATION <dir>
#     LIBRARY_DESTINATION <dir>
#     ARCHIVE_DESTINATION <dir>
#     INCLUDES_DESTINATION <dir>
#     [INCLUDES_FILES_MATCHING_PATTERN <pattern>]
#     EXPORT_NAME <export-name>
#     EXPORT_NAMESPACE <export-namespace>
#     INSTALL_NAMESPACE <install-namespace>
#     [IS_UNIX_SYSTEM_WIDE <true>]
#     [VERSION <version>]
#     [SOVERSION <version>]
#     [VERSION_COMPATIBILITY <AnyNewerVersion|SameMajorVersion|ExactVersion>]
#     [RUNTIME_COMPONENT <component-name>]
#     [DEVELOPMENT_COMPONENT <component-name>]
#   )
#
# Install ``target`` using :command:`install(TARGETS)` to the various given destinations.
#
# Will also install the headers to the destination specified by ``INCLUDES_DESTINATION`` using :command:`install(DIRECTORY)`.
# The headers of all directories specified in the ``INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` property of ``target`` will be installed.
# By default, Ã  pattern matching ``*.h`` and ``*.hpp`` is used to filter which files must be copied.
# An alternate pattern can be passed as ``INCLUDES_FILES_MATCHING_PATTERN`` argument.
#
# The ``EXPORT_NAME`` and ``EXPORT_NAMESPACE`` will be set as properties to ``target``:
#
# .. code-block:: cmake
#
#   set_target_properties(${target} PROPERTIES EXPORT_NAME ${EXPORT_NAME} EXPORT_NAMESPACE ${EXPORT_NAMESPACE})
#
# Package config files will also be generated using :command:`install(TARGETS ... EXPORT ...)`.
# Those files will contain the definition of the imported target, named ``${EXPORT_NAMESPACE}${EXPORT_NAME}``.
# Those files will also be installed using :command:`install(EXPORT)`.
#
# A package config file named ``${INSTALL_NAMESPACE}${EXPORT_NAME}Config.cmake`` is also generated
# and installed using :command:`mdt_install_package_config_file()`.
#
# If a VERSION, and maybe a SOVERSION, is specified, it will be set as properties to ``target``:
#
# .. code-block:: cmake
#
#   # Only called if the VERSION argument is set
#   set_target_properties(${target} PROPERTIES VERSION ${VERSION})
#
#   # Only called if the SOVERSION argument is set
#   set_target_properties(${target} PROPERTIES SOVERSION ${SOVERSION})
#
# If a VERSION is specified, a package config version file named ``${INSTALL_NAMESPACE}${EXPORT_NAME}ConfigVersion.cmake``
# is also generated and installed using :command:`mdt_install_package_config_version_file()`.
#
# All generated package configuration files will be installed to ``${LIBRARY_DESTINATION}/cmake/${INSTALL_NAMESPACE}${EXPORT_NAME}``,
# which is a standard location for :command:`find_package()`.
#
# Some package informations will also be attached as properties of ``target``.
# Those properties will be reused when a other target, that depends on ``target``, is installed.
# For more informations of package properties, see :command:`mdt_set_target_package_properties_if_not()`.
# The following package properties are defined:
#  - ``INTERFACE_FIND_PACKAGE_NAME``: set to ``${INSTALL_NAMESPACE}${EXPORT_NAME}``
#  - ``INTERFACE_FIND_PACKAGE_VERSION``: set to ``${VERSION}`` if ``VERSION`` argument was specified, otherwise it is not defined
#  - ``INTERFACE_FIND_PACKAGE_EXACT``: set to ``TRUE`` if ``VERSION_COMPATIBILITY`` argument is ``ExactVersion``, otherwise it is not defined
#  - ``INTERFACE_FIND_PACKAGE_PATHS``: set to ``..`` if ``IS_UNIX_SYSTEM_WIDE`` argument was not specified, or passed ``FALSE``,
#    otherwise it is not defined
#  - ``INTERFACE_FIND_PACKAGE_NO_DEFAULT_PATH``: set to ``TRUE`` if ``IS_UNIX_SYSTEM_WIDE`` argument was not specified, or passed ``FALSE``, otherwise it is not defined
#
#
# TODO: review above
#
# NOTE: for RPATH, simply add ``.`` to origin if not ``IS_UNIX_SYSTEM_WIDE``.
#
# NOTE: for executables (installed in bin), set origin to ``..``. Not the purpose of mdt_install_library()..
#
# NOTE: see RPATH doc from CMAke: maybe global variables to set project-wise !
#
# NOTE: for find_package() also simply add first search to ``PATHS ..`` as proposed in :command:`mdt_install_package_config_file()` (not dependent of ``IS_UNIX_SYSTEM_WIDE``).
# This should fit 95% of use cases !
# Later, with experience, a good name could be found for some argument..
#
#
# Example:
#
# .. code-block:: cmake
#
#   add_library(Mdt_ItemEditor_Widgets
#     sourc1.cpp sourc2.cpp ...
#   )
#
#   target_link_libraries(Mdt_ItemEditor_Widgets
#     PUBLIC Mdt::ItemModel Qt5::Widgets
#   )
#
#   target_include_directories(Mdt_ItemEditor_Widgets
#     PUBLIC
#       $<BUILD_INTERFACE:${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}>
#       $<BUILD_INTERFACE:${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}>
#     PRIVATE
#       $<BUILD_INTERFACE:${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/Private>
#   )
#
#   # This should be set at the top level CMakeLists.txt
#   set(MDT_INSTALL_PACKAGE_NAME Mdt0)
#   include(GNUInstallDirs)
#   include(MdtInstallDirs)
#
#   mdt_install_library(
#     TARGET Mdt_ItemEditor_Widgets
#     RUNTIME_DESTINATION ${CMAKE_INSTALL_BINDIR}
#     LIBRARY_DESTINATION ${CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR}
#     ARCHIVE_DESTINATION ${CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR}
#     INCLUDES_DESTINATION ${MDT_INSTALL_INCLUDEDIR}
#     EXPORT_NAME ItemEditor_Widgets
#     EXPORT_NAMESPACE Mdt0::
#     INSTALL_NAMESPACE Mdt0
#     IS_UNIX_SYSTEM_WIDE ${MDT_INSTALL_IS_UNIX_SYSTEM_WIDE}
#     VERSION ${PROJECT_VERSION}
#     SOVERSION ${PROJECT_VERSION_MAJOR}
#     VERSION_COMPATIBILITY ExactVersion
#     RUNTIME_COMPONENT Mdt_ItemEditor_Widgets_Runtime
#     DEVELOPMENT_COMPONENT Mdt_ItemEditor_Widgets_Dev
#   )
#
# Notice the usage of ``MDT_INSTALL_PACKAGE_NAME`` and ``MDT_INSTALL_INCLUDEDIR``.
# Those variable are used and provided by the :module:`MdtInstallDirs`
# and will help install the includes in a appropriate subdirectory.
#
# On a non system wide Linux installation, the result will be::
#
#   ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/include/Mdt/ItemEditor/TableEditor.h
#   ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/include/Mdt/ItemEditor/ItemEditor_WidgetsExport.h
#   ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/lib/libMdt0ItemEditor_Widgets.so
#   ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/lib/libMdt0ItemEditor_Widgets.so.0
#   ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/lib/libMdt0ItemEditor_Widgets.so.0.1.2
#   ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/lib/cmake/Mdt0ItemEditor_Widgets/Mdt0ItemEditor_WidgetsTargets.cmake
#   ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/lib/cmake/Mdt0ItemEditor_Widgets/Mdt0ItemEditor_WidgetsConfig.cmake
#   ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/lib/cmake/Mdt0ItemEditor_Widgets/Mdt0ItemEditor_WidgetsConfigVersion.cmake
#
#
# The ``LibraryName`` is the target property ``LIBRARY_NAME`` that have been set by mdt_add_library() .
# Will export ``Target`` as ``InstallNameSpace::LibraryName`` import target.
#
# A property ``INTERFACE_FIND_PACKAGE_NAME`` with a value ``${INSTALL_NAMESPACE}${LIBRARY_NAME}`` will also be added to the target if not allready set.
# This property will then be used to generate a package config file to find it later by the user of the installed library.
# See also this discussion: https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/issues/17006
# This idea comes from the BCM modules: https://bcm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
#
# Example::
#
#   # This should be set at the top level CMakeLists.txt
#   set(MDT_INSTALL_PACKAGE_NAME Mdt0)  # TODO should be avoided
#   include(GNUInstallDirs)
#   include(MdtInstallDirs)
#
#   mdt_install_library(
#     TARGET Mdt_Led
#     EXPORT_NAME Led
#     EXPORT_NAMESPACE Mdt0::
#     INSTALL_NAMESPACE Mdt0
#     VERSION ${PROJECT_VERSION}
#     VERSION_COMPATIBILITY ExactVersion
#     RUNTIME_COMPONENT Mdt_Led_Runtime
#     DEVELOPMENT_COMPONENT Mdt_Led_Dev
#   )
#
# Will export ``Mdt_Led`` as ``Mdt0::Led`` import target.
# The ``INTERFACE_FIND_PACKAGE_NAME`` will be set to ``Mdt0Led`` .
#
# The ``INSTALL_NAMESPACE`` argument will be used for..... example: lib${InstallNameSpace}LibraryName.so.${VERSION??}.${VERSION??}.${VERSION??}
#
# Despite MDT_INSTALL_PACKAGE_NAME and INSTALL_NAMESPACE argument are both set to Mdt0 (which is recomended for coherence), their usage are different....
#  TODO Also document: name clashes on system wide install on Linux
#
# Several components will be created:
#  - Mdt_Led_Runtime: lib, cmake, ..................
#  - Mdt_Led_Dev: headers, cmake ?? ................
#
# Once the library is installed, the user should be able to find it using CMake ``find_package()`` in its ``CMakeLists.txt``::
#
#   find_package(Mdt0 COMPONENTS Led REQUIRED)
#   add_executable(myApp source.cpp)
#   target_link_libraries(myApp Mdt0::Led)
#
# Example of a system wide install of MdtLed on a Debian MultiArch (`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr`)::
#
#   /usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/Mdt0/Mdt/Led.h
#   /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libMdt0Led.so.0.x.y
#   /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/cmake/Mdt0/Mdt0Config.cmake
#   /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/cmake/Mdt0Led/Mdt0LedConfig.cmake
#
# The ``/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/cmake/Mdt0/Mdt0Config.cmake`` will be installed
# by the ``Mdt0`` package, which will be a dependency of ``Mdt0Led`` package
# (A distribution will to allow that the same file is handled by diffrent packages).
#
# Example of a stand-alone install on Linux (`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/opt/MdtLed`)::
#
#   ~/opt/MdtLed/include/Mdt/Led.h
#   ~/opt/MdtLed/lib/libMdt0Led.so.0.x.y
#   ~/opt/MdtLed/lib/cmake/Mdt0/Mdt0Config.cmake
#   ~/opt/MdtLed/lib/cmake/Mdt0Led/Mdt0LedConfig.cmake
#
# Here, ``~/opt/MdtLed/lib/cmake/Mdt0/Mdt0Config.cmake`` will be generated automatically,
# allowing the usage of the component syntax of ``find_package()`` .
#
# Install a "Multi-Dev-Tools" library::
#
#   mdt_install_mdt_library(
#     TARGET Target
#   )
#
# Will export ``Target`` as ``Mdt${PROJECT_VERSION_MAJOR}::LibraryName`` import target.
# The ``LibraryName`` is the target property ``LIBRARY_NAME`` that have been set by mdt_add_mdt_library() .
#
