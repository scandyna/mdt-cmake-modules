# CMakePresets

Add for clang / libc++
Or, toolchainfile ?

# Install - presets + doc

Maybe: CMake presets for Ninja
If yes, also update doc

# MdtBuildOptionsUtils

Remove sanitizers !

# Install executable

Should versionning also be supported ?

Currently, no CMake Package version is provided by mdt_install_executable()

This will then fail:
```cmake
# find_package(Mdt0 0.0.1 COMPONENTS TableEditorExecutable REQUIRED)
```
with `Mdt0::TableEditorExecutable` a IMPORT target generated by mdt_install_executable()

# Qt

Should look [PROPERTIES MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/cmake-get-started.html)

# Install OBJECT libraries

Abandon..

# Shared libraries (file) names

On Windows, libMyLib.dll is wrong

# Component install

mdt_install_library():
 - DEVELOPMENT_COMPONENT should default to ${PROJECT_NAME}_Dev  , or not

# dll debug env

Generate a script that create the PATH as passed to the test's ENVIRONMENT

mdt_generate_runtime_environment_script(TARGET ...)

-> OR find ctest flag that does not filter out Windows debug info,
   or the file tha ctest generates with those infos
